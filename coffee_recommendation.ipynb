accuracy. Using the same dataset and different implementation of a random forest (adaboost,decision tree, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple random forest algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\n","\n","While no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset.\n","\n","The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score .\n","Given the same dataset, random forest based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\n","Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat.\n","With that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and improve the overall accuracy."]}],"metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"9dff559e18f0f234de470d87beebfd921f830fa7e2aa77e16eaddf43495f84c0"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.8.5 ('learn-env')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
